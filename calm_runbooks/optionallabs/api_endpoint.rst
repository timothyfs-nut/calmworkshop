Endpoints via API
-------------

Overview
++++++++

Endpoints can be created via the API, this gives us the ability to create them dynamically within our Blueprints. No one wants to create a large amount of Endpoints everytime an application is deployed. This example will show you how to create individual Endpoints as part of a replica set Application deployment via Calm. We will also add API scripts to cleanup the Endpoints once the Application is deleted.
