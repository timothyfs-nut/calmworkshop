Overview
++++++++

This Lab will show you how to create a Runbook. We will create a Runbook for a Linux Endpoint which includes the decision making process. Runbooks can be ran against any endpoint as long as the authentication and commands within the Runbooks are supported. Runbooks then execute the Tasks in the defined order. Tasks can include execute, set variable and http tasks which is very similar to Calm, but they also support Delays, Decisions and Loops, we will be using some of those in the exercise below.

Get Started
++++++++++++++++++++++

Open \https://<*NUTANIX-CLUSTER-IP*>:9440 in your browser to access Prism. Log in as the admin HPOC user.

Click |hamburger_menu| **> Services > Calm >** |endpoints_menu|

Here you can see the endpoint we created in the previous exercise, we will be using it for our Runbook.

Create Runbook
+++++++++++++++++++++

Click |runbooks_menu| > *+ Create Runbook*

.. |runbooks_menu| image:: images/runbooks_menu.png

Fill out the following fields:

  - **Name** - *initials*_log_cleaner
  - **Description** - Cleanup logs for Linux VMs
  - **Project** - BootcampInfra
  - **Endpoint** - *initials*_endpoint

Click **Proceed** and **Configuration** on the top middle of the window

Here we need to add two Variables which will be used in the Runbook. Click on **Add/Edit Variables** > **+ Add Variable**.

  - **Name** - log_path
  - **Data Type** - String
  - **Value** - /var/log
  - **Show Additional Options** - Tick **Mark this variable mandatory**

Click **+Add Variable** to add the second Variable.

  - **Name** - size_limit
  - **Data Type** - Integer
  - **Value** - 102400

Click the |runtime| to make sure both Variables can be edited when the Runbook is being executed.

Click **Done**.

Click **Editor** in the top middle and **+ Add Task**

.. note::
  This is where we can create the workflow for the Runbook. Each Task is ran individually. It is possible for execute type Tasks to run against endpoint with multiple IPs, Decision Tasks currently can only run agains single IP endpoints though, this is because each task is ran individually against the endpoint, for multiple IP endpoints we could end up with decisions that include true as well as false.

Update the first Task as following:

  - **Task Name** - CheckDir
  - **Type** - Decision
  - **Script Type** - Shell
  - **Script** - cd @@{log_path}@@

.. image:: images/first_task.png


Under **False** click **Add Task** and configure it:

  - **Task Name** - CheckDir_False
  - **Type** - Execute
  - **Script Type** - EScript
  - **Script**

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:
   
   print "Given Logs Directory doesn't exists"

Under **True** click **Add Task** and configure it:

  - **Task Name** - CheckDir_True
  - **Type** - Set Variable
  - **Script Type** - Shell
  - **Output** - size_before_cleanup
  - **Script** 

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   
   echo "size_before_cleanup="$(sudo du -d 0 @@{log_path}@@ | awk  "{print $1}")

Click **Add Task** and configure it:

  - **Task Name** - Cleanup
  - **Type** - Execute
  - **Script Type** - Shell
  - **Script**

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   #!/bin/bash
   if [[ $(sudo du -d 0 @@{log_path}@@ | awk  '{print $1}') -gt @@{size_limit}@@ ]]; then
    echo "INFO: Log size is more than expected. Clearing up old logs..."
    sudo rm -f @@{log_path}@@/*\.log\.*
   fi

Click **Add Task** and configure it:

  - **Task Name** - StoreLogsSizeAfterCleanup
  - **Type** - Set Variable
  - **Script Type** - Shell
  - **Output** - size_after_cleanup
  - **Script**

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:
   
   echo "size_after_cleanup="$(sudo du -d 0 @@{log_path}@@ | awk  "{print $1}")


Click **Add Task** and configure it:

  - **Task Name** - FinalOutput
  - **Type** - Execute
  - **Script Type** - EScript
  - **Script**

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   
   print 'logs size changed from @@{size_before_cleanup}@@ => @@{size_after_cleanup}@@'


Click **Save** in the top right.

Click **Execute** in the top right and select the following:

.. image:: images/execute.png

Click **Execute**.


You can now follow the Runbook and watch it execute the different Tasks.

The tabs at the bottom show the individual tasks, there the Details of the run and the output can be viewed. It will show multiple rows on endpoints with multiple IPs.


Takeaways
+++++++++

- Runbooks can be customized for anything that can be ran on the server itself, from simple shell scripts to whole binaries
- Decision points add flexiblity to react to different scenarios that can occure on the endpoint
- Variables and Endpoints in combination should be used to keep the Runbooks as generic as possible, they can then be re-used for different environments or use cases
